# Daily Report — 2025-12-19 (EAT) — Rahim Online Clothing Shop

## Done

* Ran `collectstatic` successfully and verified `staticfiles/staticfiles.json` exists (`True staticfiles\staticfiles.json`).
* Confirmed static pipeline behavior:

  * Old built assets were deleted and re-copied into `staticfiles/`.
  * `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` post-processing ran, generating hashed filenames (e.g. `dist/assets/main.<hash>.css/js`) and `.gz` versions.
* Confirmed third-party static assets (Django admin + DRF browsable API + django-extensions) are being collected and fingerprinted as expected.

## In progress

* Render deployment stability:

  * Redis configuration on Render (you captured a `redis://...:6379` style URL from Render env).
  * Database connectivity on Render (migrations/build failing with `django.db.utils.OperationalError: [Errno -2] Name or service not known`).

## Blockers

* Render Postgres DNS/host resolution error during build/migrate:

  * `psycopg.OperationalError: [Errno -2] Name or service not known`
  * This usually means `DATABASE_URL` (or DB host) is wrong/unresolvable in Render environment, or the DB instance/service name changed and the app still points to the old hostname.

## Next

* Fix Render DB wiring:

  * Ensure `DATABASE_URL` on Render is set to the **actual Internal Database URL** from the Render Postgres instance.
  * Redeploy and confirm migrations run.
* Redis wiring (if used for caching/Celery/sessions):

  * Set `REDIS_URL` from Render and update Django settings (cache + Celery broker/backend if applicable).
  * Add a quick health check/log line to confirm Redis is reachable at boot.
* After deploy is stable:

  * Verify static serving on Render (request a couple hashed assets + admin CSS).
  * Smoke test core flows (home page, product listing, cart, checkout pages).

## Links

* Render deploy logs: were green once again
* Local static verification: `staticfiles/staticfiles.json` confirmed present
